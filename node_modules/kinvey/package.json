They don't have to worry about connecting to various cloud services, setting up servers for their backend, or maintaining and scaling them.\n\nThis node module makes it very easy to connect your Node.js app with Kinvey.\n\n## How to use\n\n### 1. Sign up for Kinvey\nTo use the library, sign up for Kinvey if you have not already done so. Go to the [sign up](https://console.kinvey.com/#signup) page, and follow the steps provided.\n\n### 2. Add the library\nYou can add the library in three ways. The recommended way to add the module to your project is adding a dependency to `package.json`:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  ...\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"kinvey\": \"~0.9\"\n    ...\n  }\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nThe module will be installed when updating your project:\n\n```bash\nnpm update\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can install the module directly from the command line:\n\n```bash\nnpm install kinvey\n```\n\nFinally, you can also clone the repository and create a symbolic link to the module:\n\n\tgit clone git@github.com:Kinvey/kinvey-nodejs.git\n\tcd kinvey-nodejs\n\tnpm link\n\n### 3. Configure the library\nNow, the library is available for use in your project. Import the library in your code using `require`. Next, use `Kinvey.init` to configure your app:\n\n```javascript\nvar Kinvey = require('kinvey');\nKinvey.init({\n    appKey: 'your-app-key',\n    appSecret: 'your-app-secret'\n});\n```\n\n### 4. Verify Set Up\nYou can use the following snippet to verify the app credentials were entered correctly. This function will contact the backend and verify that the library can communicate with your app.\n\n```javascript\nKinvey.ping({\n    success: function(response) {\n        console.log('Kinvey Ping Success. Kinvey Service is alive, version: ' + response.version + ', response: ' + response.kinvey);\n    },\n    error: function(error) {\n        console.log('Kinvey Ping Failed. Response: ' + error.description);\n    }\n});\n```\n\n## Whatâ€™s next?\nYou are now ready to start building your awesome apps!
